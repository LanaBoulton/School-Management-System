# School-Management-System
Create a basic School Management System where students can register for courses, and view the course assigned to them.

Work-Flow:

* Only students with the right credentials can log in. Otherwise, a message is displayed stating: “Wrong Credentials”. 

* Valid students are able to see the courses they are registered for.
* Valid students are able to register for any course in the system as long as they are not already registered.
